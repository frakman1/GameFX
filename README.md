# GameFX
My first iOS app and github repo attempt.

The goal of this hobby project was to create an app that allowed me to add a musical element to my boardgames. A soundtrack and sound effects for each game.  

Later I expanded it to include light effects by supporting LIFX, the Wifi enabled colour bulbs. Now the bulb color changes based on the image on the screen. The brightness changes in real time to what music is getting played

####Games supported:

1-Pandemic

2-Escape

3-Forbidden Island

4-Flashpoint

5-Forbidden Desert

6-Bang (Dice Game)

7-Machi Koro

8-Ascension

The coding is shoddy and full of terrible copy and paste ugliness. I also haven't yet mastered concurrency and am not re-using code like I should. Any suggestions or re-writes would be highly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.
