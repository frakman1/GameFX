# GameFX
My first iOS app and github repo attempt.

The goal of this hobby project was to create an app that allowed me to add a musical element to my boardgames. A soundtrack and sound effects for each game
Later I expanded it to include light effects by supporting LIFX, the Wifi enabled colour bulbs.

The coding is shoddy and full of terrible copy and paste ugliness. I also haven't yet mastered concurrency and am not re-using code like I should. 

My hope/dream is that a kindly iOS or Objective-C developer would look over my code and give me pointers and offer suggestions for improvement.
I may be emailed at frakman@hotmail.com
Thank you in advance.
